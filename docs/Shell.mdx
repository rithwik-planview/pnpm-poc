# @unity/core.shell

The core idea behind this setup is that **Unity projects/capabilities can be exported as Module Federation remotes** (e.g., `libs/features/feature-1`, `feature-2`). This approach provides several benefits:

### Benefits

* **Dependency Deduplication**
  Large libraries like React, ReactDOM, PVDS, Unity Utils, etc., can be shared across different micro-frontends, reducing bundle size and duplication.

* **Independent Deployability**
  Individual projects can be deployed independently, enabling faster, safer releases.

* **Shared Singleton Instances**
  Apart from React, ReactDOM, and React Router, we could also share sensible state (e.g., Apollo cache) to improve perceived performance.

* **Great Developer Experience**
  Working with these apps in a monorepo with build-time MF support is a breeze.
  With the Module Federation Chrome Extension, we can swap out production builds with local development builds and even enable Hot Module Replacement! ü§Ø

* **Supports a Wide Range of Consumers**
  This architecture offers frictionless consumption across various environments.

## Remote Module Exports

Each remote exposes two primary modules:

* `./App`
  Exports the root React component of the micro-frontend.

* `.` (default export)
  Wraps the root component with `@unity/shell#createRemote`. This is consumed using `@unity/shell#loadRemote`.

Reference implementation: `@unity/features/feature-1`

## Consumption Modes

These federated modules can be consumed in three different ways, depending on the build environment:

### 1. With Module Federation Build Plugins

**Use Case**: A demo app within the Unity repo

**Reference**: `@unity/apps.feature-1`

```bash
pnpm -F "@unity/apps.feature-1..." build --env-mode development
pnpm -F "@unity/*.feature-1" mf-dev
```

#### Highlights:

* Consumes the `./App` export directly
* No dependency on `@unity/shell`

	D[Demo App] --> E[Directly imports ./App]
`} />

### 2. Without Module Federation Build Plugins

**Use Case**: Products using Webpack < 5 (e.g., legacy consumers)

**Reference**: `@unity/apps.demo`

```bash
pnpm -r build --env-mode development
pnpm -F "@unity/features.*" -F "@unity/apps.demo" mf-dev
```

#### Highlights:

* Consumes the `@unity/shell` npm package
* Uses `@unity/shell#loadRemote` to load the remote by name

	F[Legacy Consumer] --> G["@unity.shell#loadRemote"]
`} />

### 3. No Build Environment (Runtime-Only Support)

**Use Case**: Server-rendered UIs (e.g., AdaptiveWork, Portfolios)
**Reference**: `@unity/apps.demo-umd`

```bash
pnpm -r build --env-mode development
pnpm -F "@unity/features.*" -F "@unity/apps.demo-umd" mf-dev
```

#### Highlights:

* Consumes the UMD build of `@unity/shell`
* Uses `window.Shell#loadRemote` to load the remote by name

`} />

## Summary Table

| Mode | Consumer Type        | Loader Method               | Shell Required |
| ---- | -------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1    | Internal Demo        | Direct `./App` import       | ‚ùå              |
| 2    | Legacy (Webpack < 5) | `@unity/shell#loadRemote()` | ‚úÖ              |
| 3    | Runtime/Server Only  | `window.Shell#loadRemote()` | ‚úÖ (UMD)        |
