## Project Setup

The project uses:

### TypeScript Configuration
A sophisticated type-checking setup with project references for optimal development experience.

- Each package contains multiple TypeScript configurations:
  - `tsconfig.json`: Used by the editor
    - Covers both src/ and non-src/ files
    - Doesn't emit declarations
    - Provides full IDE support
  - `tsconfig.build.json`: Used by the bundler
    - Covers only buildable src files
    - Emits declarations for dependent projects
    - Supports project references
  - `tsconfig.mf.json`: For Module Federation remotes
    - Used by `@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin`
    - Doesn't support composite mode
    - Built using `tsc -p` command
    - Enables type sharing across federated modules

### Code Quality Tools
A comprehensive set of tools ensuring consistent code quality across the project.

- **ESLint v9**: Code quality enforcement
  - Uses the new flat config format
  - Configurations extended from `configs/eslint` folder
  - Ensures consistent code quality across packages
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
  - Centralized configuration via `.prettierrc` at root
  - Ensures consistent code style across the project
  - Integrated with the development workflow

### Testing Infrastructure
Robust testing setup for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

- **Jest**: Testing framework
  - Uses Jest with @swc/core for fast execution
  - Test configurations centralized in `configs/jest/` folder
  - Provides consistent testing environment across packages

### Documentation
Interactive documentation and component development environment.

- **Storybook**: Component documentation and testing
  - Built on react-vite framework
  - Enhanced markdown support:
    - Github Flavored Markdown (via remark-gfm)
    - Mermaid charts support (via mermaid)
  - Provides interactive component documentation

### Build System
Modern bundling solutions optimized for both applications and libraries.

- **Application Building**:
  - Built with rsbuild
  - Optimized for Module Federation
  - Development and production modes

- **Library Building**:
  - Built with rslib
  - Optimized for package distribution
  - Supports watch mode for development

- **Shared Features**:
  - Powered by rspack
  - Uses swc for TypeScript compilation
  - Multiple output formats:
    - /esm (ES modules)
    - /cjs (CommonJS)
    - /umd (Universal Module Definition)
    - /mf (Module Federation)
    - /types (TypeScript declarations)

### Package Management
Efficient dependency management and workspace organization using pnpm.

- **Workspace Management**:
  - Uses pnpm for fast, disk-space efficient package management
  - Workspaces configured via `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  - Workspace dependencies use `workspace:*` versioning
  - Supports multiple package types (apps, libraries, tools)

- **Version Control**:
  - Dependencies synchronized using syncpack
  - Package versioning follows semver with `^` range
  - Consistent versioning across all packages
  - Automated version checks in CI/CD

- **Development Scripts**:
  - Standardized script names across packages
  - Support for parallel execution
  - Environment-specific commands
  - Workspace-filtered commands

### Available Scripts
Common commands and scripts available across all packages in the workspace.

- **Build Commands**:
  - `build`: Builds the package using rsbuild/rslib
    - Apps: Uses rsbuild for application bundling
    - Libraries: Uses rslib for library packaging
  - `deploy-package`: Builds and deploys a package with its dependencies
    - Useful for Module Federation remotes
    - Includes dependency resolution

- **Development Commands**:
  - `dev`: Development mode with watch capabilities
    - Hot Module Replacement enabled
    - Automatic rebuilds on changes
  - `mf-dev`: Module Federation development mode
    - Starts development server for federated modules
    - Enables remote module hot-reloading
  - `preview`: Preview production build locally

- **Type Checking**:
  - `typecheck`: Comprehensive type checking
    - `typecheck:all`: Checks all files (src and non-src)
    - `typecheck:build`: Checks only buildable files
  - Validates TypeScript configurations
  - Ensures type compatibility across packages

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - `lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality
    - Uses project-specific ESLint configs
    - Enforces coding standards
  - `format`: Formats code using Prettier
    - Ensures consistent code style
    - Can be run with `--write` or `--check`
  - `test`: Runs Jest tests
    - `test:ci`: Runs tests with coverage reporting
    - Parallel test execution for speed

- **Internationalization**:
  - `i18n`: Compiles localization files
    - Extracts messages from source code
    - Generates type definitions
    - Updates translation files

- **Utility Commands**:
  - `serve:local-build-drop`: Starts local server for testing
  - `clean`: Removes build artifacts and caches
  - `prepare`: Sets up git hooks and project requirements
