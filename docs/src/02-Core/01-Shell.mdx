# Unity Shell (@unity/core.shell)

The core idea behind this setup is that **Unity projects/capabilities can be exported as Module Federation remotes** (e.g., `libs/features/feature-1`, `feature-2`). 

## Benefits

* **Dependency Deduplication**
  Large libraries like React, ReactDOM, PVDS, Unity Utils, etc., can be shared across different micro-frontends, reducing bundle size and duplication.

* **Independent Deployability**
  Individual projects can be deployed independently, enabling faster, safer releases.

* **Shared Singleton Instances**
  Apart from React, ReactDOM, and React Router, we could also share sensible state (e.g., Apollo cache) to improve perceived performance.

* **Great Developer Experience**
  Working with these apps in a monorepo with build-time MF support is a breeze.
  With the Module Federation Chrome Extension, we can swap out production builds with local development builds and even enable Hot Module Replacement! ðŸ¤¯

* **Supports a Wide Range of Consumers**
  This architecture offers frictionless consumption across various environments.

## Remote Module Exports

Each remote exposes two primary modules:

* `./App`
  Exports the root React component of the micro-frontend.

* `.` (default export)
  Wraps the root component with `@unity/shell#createRemote`. This is consumed using `@unity/shell#loadRemote`.

Reference implementation: `@unity/features/feature-1`
