# API

## Color

You can customize the color of the icons by using the icon colors exported from `@planview/pv-utilities`. In special cases, you can also provide specific hex, rgb, etc. colors (any valid browser color will work).

## Size

The official sizes used by the design system are exported as `iconSizes` from `@planview/pv-utilities`

There are two sets of variables exported from `iconSizes`:

- Uppercase variables like `SIZE_SMALL` which are objects that configure both [the IconContainer size](https://design.planview.com/components/data-display/icon-container) and the icon size
- Lowercase variables like `small` which are numbers that omit the container, and only set the size of the icon

### With containers

In almost all cases of building new interfaces with the design system you will want to use the the variant with the container.

### Without containers

In some cases where you need to use an icon with non-design system components you may need it without the outer container. For those cases you can use our lowercase size variables or just a number.
